\arguments{
\item{c_obj}{object of class 'COMPASSResult', or a list of such objects. Provides
COMPASS data to plot.}

\item{dir_save}{character. Where to save the output. Default is working directory.}

\item{type}{'pp' and/or 'scores'. Specifies response type(s) to plot.
If 'pp' is included, then posterior probabilities of individual cytokine combinations are plotted.
If 'scores' is included, then the PFS and FS responses are included. Note that, at this stage,
'pp' needs to be included, and so is added even if missing from \code{type}. Default is \code{c('pp', 'scores')}.}

\item{save}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, then plots are saved. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{save_format}{'pdf' or 'png'. Plot device to use. Default is 'png'.}

\item{prob_min, quant_min}{[0,1]. Specify the minimum probability of a response for the minimum quantile
of samples that a cytokine combination must have to be included. For example,
if \code{prob_min == 0.5} and quant_min == {0.1}, then only cytokine combinations for which
at least 10% of observations had a probability of a response of 0.5 or greater will plotted.
Default is \code{0.8} and \code{0.25}.}

\item{silent}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, then any warnings that would have been otherwise given
are not. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{cyt_order}{character. If not \code{NULL}, then the order in which cytokines are arranged
vertically along the annotation grid is given by this vector (with first element going at the bottom).
If \code{NULL}, then cytokines are ordered by their order in COMPASS output. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{file}{character. Name of saved plot. If \code{NULL}, then
set to `compass_boxplots`.}

\item{plot_prob_fill}{character. If a colour, then the boxplots are filled according
to the specified value. If a named vector of colours names correspond to names
of the bottom-most level of the \code{c_obj} lists, then boxplots are filled
accordingly.  Otherwise, boxplots are filled according to names of lower-most list but using}

\item{shift_plot_grid_x}{[0,1]. Extent to shift prob_plot. Increasing it from 0 moves the start of
the probability plot further to the right. Maximum value is 1 (at which point the plot will
effectively be pushed off the plotting surface). Useful to increase to a value such as 0.01
if the cytokine names are long and push the labelling grid too far to the right. Tweak as required.
Default is \code{0}.}

\item{shift_plot_scores_y}{numeric vector of length two, restricted to [-1,1]. Specifies the amount to
squeeze the scores plot in. The first element controls the bottom position of the plot,
and the second the top. For both elements, a positive value means moving upwards. A value of zero corresponds no shift.
Typically the bottom element and top element should both be shifted down (and therefore have negative values).
Only applies if type includes both \code{'pp'} and \code{'scores'}.
Default is \code{c(0,0)}.}

\item{shift_plot_pp_y}{[0,1]. Specifies amount by which to shift the upper point of the probability plot upwards.
Positive values make it larger. Typically you want to shift this down, if anything, so use negative values.
Default is 0.}

\item{shift_label}{numeric vector, values in \code{[0,1]}. Specifies amount by which to shift
the labels of the plot (if used). Default is \code{c(0.05, -0.04)}.}

\item{prop_pp}{numeric vector, values in \code{[0,1]}. Specifies coordinate-wise the proportion of plot region
for a single group in \code{c_obj} (if \code{c_obj} is a list; otherwise it's simply the proportion of the
plot) that is devoted (before applying \code{shift_plot_pp_y}) to the plot of posterior probabilities.
The first element is the proportion allocated to the probability plot along the x-axis, and (\code{1-prop_pp[1]}) is
then the space allocated to the scores plot. The first element is set equal to 0 if there is no scores plot.
The second element is the proportion allocate to the probabilty plot along the y-axis, and (\code{1-prop_pp[1]}) is
then the space allocated to the cytokine indicator grid.}

\item{label}{logical. If \code{TRUE} and \code{c_obj} is a list, then the names of
elements in \code{c_obj} are used as labels for sub-figures.
If \code{c_obj} is not a list, then no label is printed, regardless of the
value of \code{label}. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{return_plot_list}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, then a named list of the plots used to create the figure are returned. The
first element is \code{'p_grid'} for the cytokine grid plot. The second element is \code{'p_probs'}  for
a list of the posterior probability plots. The third element is named \code{'p_scores'}, and has sub-elements that
are the plots of the PFS and FS responses for each group. The \code{'p_scores'} element is only supplied if \code{'scores'} is
in \code{'type'}.}

\item{facet}{logical vector. Whether to facet or save individual plots for each
group in \code{c_obj}. If \code{TRUE} only, then only a faceted version is saved.
If \code{FALSE} only, then plots are saved individually. If \code{c(TRUE, FALSE)},
then both the facted and individual plots are saved.}

\item{height, width}{numeric. Height and width, respectively (of course), of the saved figure (if saved). If
\code{NULL}, then appropriate values are guessed at and used. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{cyt_lab}{function. A function that takes the cytokine names as input and returns the
value desired to be plotted along the y-axis of the grid plot. If not \code{NULL}, then
it is supplied when creating the grid plot to the \code{scale_y_continuous} function
via the \code{labels} parameter. For example, if we have two cytokines, \code{"IFNg"} and
\code{"TNF"}, but we want to display \code{"IFNg"} with the Greek gamma symbol, then we can
set \code{cyt_lab} equal to the following: \code{cyt_lab = function(cyt) purrr::map(cyt, function(cyt_ind){switch(cyt_ind, "IFNg" = bquote(paste(plain(paste("IFN")), gamma)), cyt_ind)})}.
This will change the label for \code{"IFNg"} but leave all the others as is.}
}
\value{
A list, where each element is a \code{ggplot2} object.
}
\description{
Plot COMPASS posterior probabilities as boxplots, and the PFS scores if desired.
A grid of figures is created whenever multiple COMPASS objects are plotted simultaneous, with
y-axis scales and cytokine combinations displayed fixed across plots.

\examples{
library(compassutils)
data('c_obj_list', package = 'compassutils')
plot_compass(
c_obj = c_obj_list,
type = c('pp', 'scores'),
return_plot_list = FALSE,
shift_plot_scores = c(-0.05, 0.05),
shift_plot_pp_y = -0.075,
shift_plot_grid_x = 0.052
)
The plot will then be saved to the working directory.

Can also use Greek symbols for cytokines:
get_cyt_lab <- function(cyt){
  lapply(cyt, function(cyt_ind){
  switch(cyt_ind,
  "IFNg" = bquote('IFN'~gamma),
  cyt_ind)
  })
 }
 plot_compass(c_obj_list[1], type = c('pp'),
 return = FALSE, shift_plot_scores = c(-0.05, 0.05), facet = FALSE,
 shift_plot_pp_y = -0.05, shift_plot_grid_x = 0.052, cyt_lab = get_cyt_lab)
