Version: 0.1.6
Authors@R: person(given = c("Miguel", "Julio"),
                  family = "Rodo",
                  role = c("aut", "cre"),
                  email = "rdxmig002@myuct.ac.za")
Description: Primary function thus far is plot_compass, 
    which plots posterior probabilities for each cytokine combination
	using more concise alternatives to the COMPASS::plot function's grid. 
	Also has `convert_cyt_combn_format`, for converting between "standard" and COMPASS
	cytokine combination formats.
